Difference between Classification and Regression:



Classifcation: It is a method in Supervised learning  which labels the final output into groups like whether a musical instrument is piano or guitar. It classifies the output into groups based on the patterns and learnings from the data we trained
Common Classification models:Logistic Regression, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) ,Decision Tree ,Naive Bayes.
Reggression: It is a method in supervised learning which predicts a continuos value ranged outputs like what will my CPI be this semester. It works on data that predicts a continuous range based values.
Common Regression models: Linear regression,Polynomial Regression, Descision tree regression.

Scenarios Where Sueperwised learning applies:
intially the data must need to satisfy the following criteria
1] when you have a clear data which is categorised into classes or labelled clearly.
2] when the correct output (target value) is known for every input, so the model can learn by comparing its prediction with the actual answer.
3] When the goal is to predict future outcomes based on past labeled data (such as predicting marks, prices, or classes).
Examples:
Email spam or legit(Classification)
prediction of price(Regression)
