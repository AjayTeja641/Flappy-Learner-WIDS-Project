Common Classification models:Logistic Regression, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) ,Decision Tree ,Naive Bayes.
Reggression: It is a method in supervised learning which predicts a continuos value ranged outputs like what will my CPI be this semester. It works on data that predicts a continuous range based values.
Common Regression models: Linear regression,Polynomial Regression, Descision tree regression.
